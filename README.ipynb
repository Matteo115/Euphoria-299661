    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Visualization**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Statistical Summaries**:\n",
    "     - Use `DataFrame.describe()` to get basic statistics for numerical features.\n",
    "     - Use `DataFrame.value_counts()` or similar methods to understand distributions for categorical variables.\n",
    "   - **Visualizations**:\n",
    "     - Histograms or box plots for `happiness_index`, `loyalty_score`, `island_size`, etc., to assess distributions and potential outliers.\n",

    "### 2. **Define Problem Type (Regression, Classification, or Clustering)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Define the Objective**: \n",
    "     - If you want to predict a continuous outcome, like `happiness_index`, it’s a **regression** problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 4. **Generate Training and Test Sets**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Split the data into training and test sets (e.g., an 80/20 split).\n",
    "   - The test set should be kept separate and only used for final performance evaluation.\n",
    "   - If the dataset size is large, you could use a validation set instead of cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Select and Test Models**\n",
    "\n",

    "       - For regression models: regularization parameters for Linear Regression, number of trees in Random Forest, learning rate for Gradient Boosting.\n",
    "       - For clustering models: number of clusters (K) in K-Means, minimum cluster size for DBSCAN.\n",
    "   - **Hyperparameter Description**: Document each hyperparameter you tuned and the rationale for choosing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Select the Best Model Using the Right Metric**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Choose Metrics Based on Problem Type**:\n",
    "     - For **regression**: Use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or R².\n",
    "     - For **clustering**: Use metrics like Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, or inertia (for K-Means).\n",
    "   - Compare the model performances on the validation set and select the best model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Evaluate Performance on the Test Set**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Compute Test Set Metrics**:\n",
    "     - Once the best model is selected, evaluate its performance on the test set.\n",
    "     - Report the final metric values (e.g., R², MSE for regression; silhouette score for clustering) to assess generalization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Comparison of Different Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Summarize Model Performance**:\n",

    "   - **Interpret Model Differences**:\n",
    "     - Describe why one model may perform better than others and highlight strengths/weaknesses of each approach.\n",
    "   - **Explain the Impact of Hyperparameter Tuning**:\n",
    "     - Mention how tuning improved performance for each model where applicable.\n",
